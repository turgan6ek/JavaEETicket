            Currently, a movie theater in the cinema industry is not a mere public facility with an auditorium. Apart from a nice display picture,
            the key requirements of today's moviegoers also include an opportunity to choose a movie at any time convenient for them,
            a seat where they could stretch their legs to spend comfortably 1.5 hours watching a movie in a cosy and stylish place, and where they
            could have some delicious refreshment prior to the screening. Do many motion-picture theaters meet such high expectations? Absolutely not. Hence,
            the Kinopark Theatres network stands distinctive, being the leading cinema in Kazakhstan, and rightfully so. The Kinopark Theatres cinema theaters
            already meet the highest requirements laid for the new generation cinemas: a modern stylish design, high technologies to ensure the best sound and picture,
            cosy and ergonomic chairs, including seats for persons with special needs. However, as you know, there is no limit to perfection. Kinopark Theatres has been making
            an important contribution to Kazakhstan's cultural heritage by strengthening the Country 's standing in the global cinema industry.
